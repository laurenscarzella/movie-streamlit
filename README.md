# Top Movies and Genre Insights Streamlit App
This repository contains all the files you need to explore movie trends and analyze movie popularity over time using the [TMBD API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started). It generates a Streamlit app to enable users to visualize top movies, genre popularity trends, and movie counts by genre for a given year.
